# Changelog

All notable changes to Antinomie. Versions follow semantic versioning; see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#12-versioning). Each version says which bases
it runs.

## 0.3.0 — unreleased

Needs new bases for the transport settings and Never drop mode (BusyBox and
Debian 13 (GNOME) for Antinomie 0.3.0). Bases for 0.2.0 and 0.1.0 still run,
with 256 KiB buffers that drop when full.

- **Capture All by process.** A capture lists the processes it observed as a
  tree, named after the program each one executed (or its command name when
  it was already running), with call counts and exit codes. Selecting one
  shows only its calls, live and in saved captures (`processes.json`).
- **Telemetry transport settings** (VM **Settings → Telemetry transport…**):
  guest buffer per vCPU (256 KiB to 4 MiB, default 1 MiB), **Never drop**
  (the default: a system call waits up to 5 s for the host instead of losing
  its record) or **Drop new telemetry**, and the host event table size
  (default 16,384). Capture All over a GNOME boot lost 52-80 % when dropping
  and nothing in Never drop mode.
- Recording writes go to a background writer thread with a 256 MiB queue, so
  a slow disk no longer stalls telemetry draining; in Never drop mode a disk
  that stays too slow slows the guest instead of losing data.
- The host event table retires finished calls first; only calls still in
  progress count as evicted.
- **Network capture.** With NAT on, start and stop captures without restarting
  the VM. Each capture has its own pcap in the boot recording, outside the
  guest. The **Network** panel offers capture history, protocol colors,
  clickable address/port/protocol filters and counted dropdowns, with a byte
  view and Wireshark integration.
- Process terminals freely resize and maximize, update the guest terminal
  grid, and retain 10,000 history lines with wheel and scrollbar navigation.
- **Details** offers common numeric copy formats and captured-data windows
  with UTF-8, ASCII, hex, hexdump, C array, Base64 and escaped forms. Invalid
  extents are rejected, and partial captures keep their gap/error status.
- Static analysis names the categories still queued or running until the
  selected report finishes.
- Commands queued while the transport thread is busy are handled together
  instead of one per pass.
- **Run in the guest desktop.** On desktop bases, **Run in** in the launch
  dialog runs a program in the logged-in graphical session, so its windows
  appear on the VM screen (**Guest desktop**), or in a terminal window on the
  VM screen (**Guest desktop terminal**). The program stays in the run's
  process tree and trace. Run History shows each run's choice.

## 0.2.3 — 2026-10-09

Runs bases for Antinomie 0.2.0 and 0.1.0; no new bases.

- **Fewer lost telemetry packets.** While telemetry is flowing, the monitor
  now drains the guest's buffers continuously, instead of reading at most 256
  packets every 10 ms. On a Capture All stress test it saved 8.5 times as many
  packets per second.
- Raw telemetry is written in large blocks and object files stay open between
  chunks, so saving a packet costs fewer system calls.
- Guest RAM is now kept in memory instead of in a file in the VM folder. The
  host no longer writes guest memory back to disk, which used to stall the
  guest and its telemetry. RAM larger than half of memory plus swap still
  uses the file; `ANTINOMIE_GUEST_RAM=file` forces it.
- On startup, the app deletes guest RAM files left behind when the app
  closed without stopping its VM (several GB each). A running VM's file is
  kept.

## 0.2.2 — 2026-10-09

Runs bases for Antinomie 0.2.0 and 0.1.0; no new bases.

- **Download base**: clearer rows, current bases first, older bases behind
  **Show older bases**, versioned names and persistent progress with Cancel.
  Cancelled downloads retain their files for resume; closing the app stops
  its download worker.
- Installed older bases show an outdated hint and link to the download dialog;
  a matching current catalog base adds **newer base available**.
- Base checks run after the window opens, with **Checking base images…** status.
- Unchanged installed bases reuse their verified checksums. Large-file hashing
  releases Linux file cache as it reads, reducing WSL memory use on startup.
- Typed paths expand a leading `~` to the user's home directory.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-10-09

Runs bases for Antinomie 0.2.0 and 0.1.0, like 0.2.0; no new bases.

- **Tools > Analysis tools**: when capa, Detect It Easy or Ghidra is not
  installed on the system, Antinomie can download it from its upstream
  release (checked by SHA-256) into its data folder; static analysis then
  uses it, read-only, inside the sandbox. A tool installed on the system
  still comes first. The launch dialog and unavailable analysis categories
  offer the install when a needed tool is missing.
- Static analysis sandbox: tools that start from `/bin/sh` scripts and tools
  that ask for the user name (capa, Detect It Easy) now run; the sandbox has
  a neutral host name.
- Messages and the About window name app versions for bases and kernels.
- Release executables no longer contain the build machine's file paths.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-09

Runs bases for Antinomie 0.2.0; bases for 0.1.0 still run, without process
attachment and capture.

- Static analysis of the guest executable, opt-in per run, in an isolated
  sandbox: metadata, structures, all strings (ASCII and UTF-16LE), entropy,
  hardening, rules, identification, capabilities, disassembly and
  decompilation, in one workspace or separate panes.
- Disassembly built in (x86 and x86-64, iced-x86): every instruction with
  address, bytes and resolved call targets, functions from symbols and call
  targets; other architectures through objdump.
- Decompilation through a locally installed Ghidra (headless, inside the
  sandbox) or radare2, shown as numbered, highlighted source per function.
- Rules with the built-in YARA-X engine: Antinomie's own rules plus 2096
  redistributable community rules from YARA-Forge; capabilities through an
  installed capa with the bundled capa-rules v9.4.0; compiler, language,
  runtime and packer identification from built-in signatures, file magic and
  Detect It Easy when installed.
- Large results (disassembly, decompilation, strings) are kept in full and
  read page by page, with search over the whole listing.
- Attach to a guest process and its future descendants, or capture all of
  userspace, independent of launched programs. No per-boot capture limit
  (earlier guests allowed 64); the process picker lists every process with a
  filter.
- Prebuilt bases for this version: BusyBox `aaf26eed…` and Debian 13
  (GNOME) `a12b52ab…` on the Hugging Face bucket
  `MoreMorePwn/antinomie-bases`.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-08

Runs bases for Antinomie 0.1.0.

- QEMU VM monitor with a patched Linux 6.12.94 guest kernel that records
  native x86-64 system calls, their arguments and asynchronous I/O over a
  shared-memory transport (ABI 7).
- Dockable workspace: VMs, bases, runs, paired syscall trace, terminals,
  per-VM history and storage locations.
- Bases: download (checksum-verified catalog), import, and the **Build base**
  wizard: installer-style questions (base, build mode, language, keyboard,
  time zone, hostname, Debian desktop, software, mirror and proxy), built on
  this Linux host or in a QEMU builder VM, with a cached kernel per app
  version.
- Bases record the app version that built them and the oldest app version
  that can run them; the running guest kernel is checked against its base.
- Guest RAM up to 8 GiB (regions above 4 GiB mapped).
- `./run.sh` and per-user `./install.sh` (command, menu entry, icon).
- Syscall trace rows colored by category (eleven groups covering all 375
  native syscalls) with a category filter; failed calls marked in red.
- Debian builds offer the installer's desktops (GNOME, Xfce, GNOME
  Flashback, KDE Plasma, Cinnamon, MATE, LXDE, LXQt) and a base name.
- Prebuilt bases for this version: BusyBox `312bfe10…` and Debian 13
  (GNOME) `64953c89…` on the Hugging Face bucket
  `MoreMorePwn/antinomie-bases`.
