# Changelog

All notable changes to Antinomie. Versions follow semantic versioning; see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#12-versioning). Each version names the guest
contract revision its kernel patches implement.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-09

Guest contract revision 12 (kernel patch series `0001`–`0017`). Bases for
0.1.0 (revision 9) still run, without process attachment.

- Static analysis of the guest executable, opt-in per run, in an isolated
  sandbox: metadata, structures, all strings (ASCII and UTF-16LE), entropy,
  hardening, rules, identification, capabilities, disassembly and
  decompilation, in one workspace or separate panes.
- Disassembly built in (x86 and x86-64, iced-x86): every instruction with
  address, bytes and resolved call targets, functions from symbols and call
  targets; other architectures through objdump.
- Decompilation through a locally installed Ghidra (headless, inside the
  sandbox) or radare2, shown as numbered, highlighted source per function.
- Rules with the built-in YARA-X engine: Antinomie's own rules plus 2096
  redistributable community rules from YARA-Forge; capabilities through an
  installed capa with the bundled capa-rules v9.4.0; compiler, language,
  runtime and packer identification from built-in signatures, file magic and
  Detect It Easy when installed.
- Large results (disassembly, decompilation, strings) are kept in full and
  read page by page, with search over the whole listing.
- Attach to a guest process and its future descendants, or capture all of
  userspace, independent of launched programs. No per-boot capture limit
  (earlier guests allowed 64); the process picker lists every process with a
  filter.
- Prebuilt bases for this version: BusyBox and Debian 13 (GNOME) on the
  Hugging Face bucket `MoreMorePwn/antinomie-bases`.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-08

Guest contract revision 9 (kernel patch series `0001`–`0013`).

- QEMU VM monitor with a patched Linux 6.12.94 guest kernel that records
  native x86-64 system calls, their arguments and asynchronous I/O over a
  shared-memory transport (ABI 7).
- Dockable workspace: VMs, bases, runs, paired syscall trace, terminals,
  per-VM history and storage locations.
- Bases: download (checksum-verified catalog), import, and the **Build base**
  wizard: installer-style questions (base, build mode, language, keyboard,
  time zone, hostname, Debian desktop, software, mirror and proxy), built on
  this Linux host or in a QEMU builder VM, with a cached kernel per patch
  series.
- Bases record their kernel's contract revision, the app version that built
  them and the oldest app version that can run them; the running guest
  kernel is checked against its base.
- Guest RAM up to 8 GiB (regions above 4 GiB mapped).
- `./run.sh` and per-user `./install.sh` (command, menu entry, icon).
- Syscall trace rows colored by category (eleven groups covering all 375
  native syscalls) with a category filter; failed calls marked in red.
- Debian builds offer the installer's desktops (GNOME, Xfce, GNOME
  Flashback, KDE Plasma, Cinnamon, MATE, LXDE, LXQt) and a base name.
- Prebuilt bases for this version: BusyBox `312bfe10…` and Debian 13
  (GNOME) `64953c89…` on the Hugging Face bucket
  `MoreMorePwn/antinomie-bases`.
